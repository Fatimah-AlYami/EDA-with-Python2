    "4. Relevant Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "   This dataset is based on \"Bank Marketing\" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).\n",
    "   The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.\n",
    "   This dataset is almost identical to the one used in [Moro et al., 2014] (it does not include all attributes due to privacy concerns). \n",
    "   Using the rminer package and R tool (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminer/), we found that the addition of the five new social and economic attributes (made available here) lead to substantial improvement in the prediction of a success, even when the duration of the call is not included. Note: the file can be read in R using: d=read.table(\"bank-additional-full.csv\",header=TRUE,sep=\";\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The zip file includes two datasets: \n",
    "      1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).\n",
    "      2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from bank-additional-full.csv.\n",
    "   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "   The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Number of Instances: 41188 for bank-additional-full.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Number of Attributes: 20 + output attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Attribute information:\n",
    "\n",
    "   For more information, read [Moro et al., 2014].\n",

    "   Input variables:\n",
    "   # bank client data:\n",
    "   1 - age (numeric)\n",
    "   2 - job : type of job (categorical: \"admin.\",\"blue-collar\",\"entrepreneur\",\"housemaid\",\"management\",\"retired\",\"self-employed\",\"services\",\"student\",\"technician\",\"unemployed\",\"unknown\")\n",
    "   3 - marital : marital status (categorical: \"divorced\",\"married\",\"single\",\"unknown\"; note: \"divorced\" means divorced or widowed)\n",
    "   4 - education (categorical: \"basic.4y\",\"basic.6y\",\"basic.9y\",\"high.school\",\"illiterate\",\"professional.course\",\"university.degree\",\"unknown\")\n",
    "   5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: \"no\",\"yes\",\"unknown\")\n",
    "   6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: \"no\",\"yes\",\"unknown\")\n",
    "   7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: \"no\",\"yes\",\"unknown\")\n",
    "   # related with the last contact of the current campaign:\n",
    "   8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: \"cellular\",\"telephone\") \n",
    "   9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: \"jan\", \"feb\", \"mar\", ..., \"nov\", \"dec\")\n",
    "  10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: \"mon\",\"tue\",\"wed\",\"thu\",\"fri\")\n",
    "  11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note:  this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=\"no\"). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n",
    "   # other attributes:\n",
    "  12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n",
    "  13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n",
    "  14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "  15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: \"failure\",\"nonexistent\",\"success\")\n",
    "   # social and economic context attributes\n",
    "  16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n",
    "  17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)     \n",
    "  18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)     \n",
    "  19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)\n",
    "  20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n",

    "  Output variable (desired target):\n",
    "  21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: \"yes\",\"no\")\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Missing Attribute Values: There are several missing values in some categorical attributes, all coded with the \"unknown\" label. These missing values can be treated as a possible class label or using deletion or imputation techniques. \n"
